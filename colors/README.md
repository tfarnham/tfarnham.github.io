## Description of the project
This grid of colors has been scrambled, and it's your job to fix it

Click to swap the colors between any two (non-corner) tiles, to reform the original two-dimensional gradient. Click the same tile twice to deselect, and try to unscramble the puzzle in the fewest moves

## How to Run
Download all files then open index.html in your browser

## Roadmap of future improvements
Nice to haves:
- Animated transitions when the boxes switch places
- User-selectable grid dimensions
- User-selectable corner colors (to form a dynamic new grid)

Some stretch objectives:
- Boxes dynamically resize as the window resizes
- Different shaped grides (circular, or fancy-shaped)
- Progress-tracking and the ability to complete "levels"
- Record a user's moves to playback or compare to other users
- Count the theoretical least number of moves
